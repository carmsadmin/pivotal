- git'it, then mvn clean deploy/install
- Stable Version 1.0.1 - STABLE (minor fixes) 
- Stable Version 1.0.9 - STABLE (major fix in json deserializer)
  if you are using the json deserializer, I highly recommend you use 1.0.9

- String, Number, and a bunch of other utilities.

- Reflection utilities.

- json serializer and deserializers, could be used in spring 
(https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-5087)

- bunch of other stuff, just check out the code, I'm sure 
you'll figure it out, or ask.

* More updates will come, when I get time to actually update the site.
